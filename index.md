### About 

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the lab of [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu) in the department of [Biostatistics and Computational Biology](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org) and the [Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu).

I earned my PhD in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin Madison](http://www.wisc.edu) in May 2015 under the direction of [Christina Kendziorski](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/). 

My research focuses on developing statistical methodology and computational tools for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics data. Most of my work has revolved around experiments that use next-generation sequencing technologies to characterize the genomic basis of complex traits. I have focused on problems of analyzing the mutation spectrum of cancer genomes, studying the gene expression of single cells, and characterizing changes in genome-wide methylation patterns.
